Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning:
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them. Here I have firstly analyse the data and then performed Logistic Regression Algorithm for further accurate classification.
